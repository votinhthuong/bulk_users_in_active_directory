# bulk_users_in_active_directory
Create Bulk Users in Active Directory in Powershell

First of all, I don't own this original code. You can find the pure and simple code in this link: 
https://activedirectorypro.com/create-bulk-users-active-directory/

Based on this, I try to improve it a little by add some more code to check exists of OUs in Active Directory.

I have added comment for my code in bulk_users.ps1 file. Just click in it and take a look.

Thank you!
